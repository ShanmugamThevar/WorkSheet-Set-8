The key difference between ADASYN and SMOTE is that the former uses a density distribution, as a criterion to automatically decide the number of synthetic samples that must be generated for each minority sample by adaptively changing the weights of the different minority samples to compensate for the skewed distributions. The latter generates the same number of synthetic samples for each original minority sample. ADASYN gives us much better detail, while SMOTE tends to cover the boundary by joining points if they’re close together.  "
